	abstract = {In Europe, reptiles have been recently included in environmental risk-assessment processes for registration of plant-protection products. However, data on toxicity effects of most compounds are lacking. Chlorpyrifos is the most commonly used organophosphorus insecticide worldwide. In the present study, the authors exposed a lacertid lizard, Podarcis bocagei, to sublethal concentrations of chlorpyrifos. Individuals were exposed through spiked food for a period of 20 d (low dose 0.12 mg/kg/d, high dose 1.57 mg/kg/d). After exposure, various biomarkers of exposure and effect were evaluated, including the activities of glutathione S-transferase and enzymes involved in the glutathione redox cycle, glutathione concentrations, activities of esterases, liver and testes histopathologies, as well as locomotory and predatory behavior. The results indicate that sublethal, subchronic exposure to chlorpyrifos can affect P. bocagei in a dose-dependent manner. Adverse effects occurred at both the subindividual and individual levels, including inhibition of carboxylesterases and cholinesterases ({ChEs}), liver histopathological changes, and altered predatory behaviors. Animals exposed to chlorpyrifos took more time to capture and subdue prey items. The results suggest a link between effects at subindividual levels of organization with those observed at the whole individual level after exposure to environmentally realistic dosages of chlorpyrifos.

	abstract = {Laboratory and mesocosm experiments have demonstrated that some glyphosate-based herbicides can have negative effects on benthic invertebrate species. Although these herbicides are among the most widely used in agriculture, there have been few multiple-stressor, natural system–based investigations of the impacts of glyphosate-based herbicides in combination with fertilizers on the emergence patterns of chironomids from wetlands. Using a replicated, split-wetland experiment, the authors examined the effects of 2 nominal concentrations (2.88 mg acid equivalents/L and 0.21 mg acid equivalents/L) of the glyphosate herbicide Roundup {WeatherMax}, alone or in combination with nutrient additions, on the emergence of Chironomidae (Diptera) before and after herbicide-induced damage to macrophytes. There were no direct effects of treatment on the structure of the Chironomidae community or on the overall emergence rates. However, after macrophyte cover declined as a result of herbicide application, there were statistically significant increases in emergence in all but the highest herbicide treatment, which had also received no nutrients. There was a negative relationship between chironomid abundance and macrophyte cover on the treated sides of wetlands. Fertilizer application did not appear to compound the effects of the herbicide treatments. Although direct toxicity of Roundup {WeatherMax} was not apparent, the authors observed longer-term impacts, suggesting that the indirect effects of this herbicide deserve more consideration when assessing the ecological risk of using herbicides in proximity to wetlands.

	abstract = {The comprehensive aquatic systems model for atrazine ({CASMATZ}) estimates the potential toxic effects of atrazine on populations of aquatic plants and consumers in a generic lower-order midwestern stream. The {CASMATZ} simulates the daily production of 20 periphyton and 6 aquatic vascular plant species. The modeled consumer community consists of 17 functionally defined species of zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, bacteria, and fish. Daily values of population biomass (grams of carbon per square meter) are calculated as nonlinear functions of population bioenergetics, physical–chemical environmental parameters, grazing/predator–prey interactions, and population-specific direct and indirect responses to atrazine. The {CASMATZ} uses Monte Carlo methods to characterize the implications of phenotypic variability, environmental variability, and uncertainty associated with atrazine toxicity data in estimating the potential impacts of time-varying atrazine exposures on population biomass and community structure. Comparisons of modeled biomass values for plants and consumers with published data indicate that the generic reference simulation realistically describes ecological production in lower-order midwestern streams. Probabilistic assessments were conducted using the {CASMATZ} to evaluate potential modeled changes in plant community structure resulting from measured atrazine exposure profiles in 3 midwestern {US} streams representing watersheds highly vulnerable to runoff. Deviation in the median values of maximum 30-d average Steinhaus similarity index ranged from 0.09\% to 2.52\% from the reference simulation. The {CASMATZ} could therefore be used for the purposes of risk assessment by comparison of site monitoring–based model output to a biologically relevant Steinhaus similarity index level of concern. Used as a generic screening technology or in site-specific applications, the {CASMATZ} provides an effective, coherent, and transparent modeling framework for assessing ecological risks posed by pesticides in lower-order streams.

	abstract = {The herbicide atrazine is a photosynthetic inhibitor used around the world in agricultural applications. Contamination of surface waters adjacent to treated areas can directly reduce growth of nontarget aquatic autotrophs, but the severity of impacts is highly dependent on species sensitivity and exposure concentration. Secondary effects resulting from macrophyte or phytoplankton decline may include an expansion of the more tolerant periphyton community. Recently, this shift in the autotrophic community has been proposed as a mechanism for increased rates of parasite infections in amphibians via augmented populations of aquatic snails which act as intermediate hosts to larval trematodes. To further clarify this relationship, an outdoor microcosm study was conducted to examine the effects of atrazine on primary production and snail populations over a range of environmentally relevant concentrations. In July 2009, 15 experimental ponds were treated to achieve initial concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 30, and 100 µg/L atrazine. Over a period of 73 d, measures were taken of macrophyte, phytoplankton, and periphyton biomass, growth, and fecundity of caged snails (Physella spp. and Stagnicola elodes) and free-living snails (Physella spp.). Except for declines in macrophyte biomass at the highest treatment level, no consistent relationships were found between atrazine concentration and any measured parameter. Comparison of these results with previous findings highlights the variability of responses to atrazine exposure between similarly constructed freshwater communities, even at concentrations up to 20 times higher than sustained environmental levels.

	abstract = {Ecological Risk Assessment ({ERA}) of chemicals in mesocosms requires measurement of a large number of parameters at community scale. Studies on invertebrate communities usually focus on taxonomic approaches which only provide insights into taxonomic structure changes induced by chemicals. In the present study, abundance, biomass (B), theoretical production (P) and instantaneous P/B ratio were used as endpoints to assess the effects of the commercial form of the dithiocarbamate fungicide thiram (35 and 170 µg/L nominal concentrations) and of the hydrocarbon water accommodated fraction ({HWAF}) of a petroleum distillate (0.01, 0.4, 2 and 20 mg/L loadings) on zooplankton community in freshwater pond mesocosms. Endpoints were measured during a 4-week treatment period (one pulse per week) followed by a 5-month post-treatment period to evaluate zooplankton population recovery. Chlorophyll a concentration in water significantly increased after treatment to {HWAF} whereas it was not affected by thiram treatment. Zooplankton abundance-based analysis showed effects on a limited number of taxa, whereas other endpoints (mainly P/B ratio) revealed that more taxa were impacted, with recovery depending on the chemical and concentration. {HWAF} exposure mainly had a negative impact on cladocerans which resulted in top-down effects (between cladocerans and phytoplankton). Thiram negatively affected rotifers and copepods suggesting more direct toxic effects. Our results show that the use of secondary production as an endpoint provide a more comprehensive assessment of potential direct and indirect effects of chemicals on community and support evidence of alteration on functional processes.

Disruption of the {GABAergic} system by environmental contaminants could interfere with normal regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to impaired fish reproduction. The present study used a 21-d fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) reproduction assay to investigate the reproductive toxicity of fipronil ({FIP}), a broad-spectrum phenylpyrazole insecticide that acts as a noncompetitive blocker of {GABA} receptor–gated chloride channels. Continuous exposure up to 5 µg {FIP}/L had no significant effect on most of the endpoints measured, including fecundity, secondary sexual characteristics, plasma steroid and vitellogenin concentrations, ex vivo steroid production, and targeted gene expression in gonads or brain. The gonad mass, gonadosomatic index, and histological stage of the gonad were all significantly different in females exposed to 0.5 µg {FIP}/L compared with those exposed to 5.0 µg {FIP}/L; however, there were no other significant effects on these measurements in the controls or any of the other treatments in either males and females. Overall, the results do not support a hypothesized adverse outcome pathway linking {FIP} antagonism of the {GABA} receptor(s) to reproductive impairment in fish.

	abstract = {The European Union's directive for sustainable use of pesticides requires implementing risk mitigation measures at streams threatened by pesticide entries. The need for mitigation measures was investigated at 10 stream sites within an intensively used arable region in central Germany by characterizing pesticide exposure following edge-of-field runoff and effects on the aquatic macroinvertebrates. Moreover, the influence of riparian buffer strip width (as a mitigation measure) at the sampling sites was considered. Generally, invertebrate fauna was dominated by pesticide-tolerant species, suggesting a high pesticide exposure at almost all sites. This result is also reflected by the elevated levels of suspended particle contamination in terms of toxic units ({logTUMax} {\textgreater} −2), corresponding to one-hundredth of the median lethal concentration ({LC}50) to Daphnia magna. At two sites that received high aqueous-phase entries of the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin ({logTUMax} {\textgreater} −0.6), the abundance and number of sensitive species in terms of the species at risk index decreased during the pesticide application period. In contrast, no acute significant negative effects on macroinvertebrates were observed at sites characterised by low water-phase toxicity ({logTUMax} {\textless} –3.5). An influence of riparian buffer strip width on pesticide exposure was not observed, supposedly because of the presence of erosion rills and ephemeral ditches. In conclusion, results show that mitigation measures (such as the improvement of currently present riparian buffer strips) are needed in the study area.

	abstract = {Changes in percentage of forest cover can influence nutrient levels in aquatic systems and change abiotic conditions that may influence species. The authors examined how increasing amounts of leaf litter influenced toxicity of the insecticide carbaryl using larval green frogs (Rana clamitans) in outdoor mesocosm ponds. Insecticides can have direct negative effects on individual physiology and behavior and indirect effects on the food web, which can result in trophic cascades. They predicted that direct effects of the insecticide would dominate when nutrients were low (resulting in negative impacts on amphibian development and survival), whereas indirect effects could offset direct effects when nutrients were more abundant through a trophic cascade that leads to more food for tadpoles (resulting in positive effects on amphibian development and survival). The authors found support for this hypothesis: first, total green frog survival was greatest with increased leaf litter input in the presence of carbaryl. Additionally, most green frogs that reached metamorphosis were from ponds with high leaf litter input and carbaryl. Second, the impact of carbaryl on developmental stage and tadpole mass varied depending on the amount of leaf litter present. With high amounts of leaf litter, carbaryl had a positive impact on development and growth; in contrast, with low amounts of leaf litter, carbaryl had negative or no effects on tadpole development and mass. The present study suggests that differences in nutrient levels between ponds exposed to pesticides could play a role in amphibian population dynamics. Environ. Toxicol.

Subsequent to a grow-up period of 24 to 72 h to establish requisite cell density for adequate signal strength to measure photosystem {II} ({PSII}) quantum yield, algae were exposed to a pulse of atrazine for 48 h followed by a 48-h recovery period in control media. Photosynthesis was measured at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h of the exposure and recovery phases using pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry; growth rate and cell density were also concomitantly measured at these time points. Exposure to atrazine resulted in immediate, but temporary, inhibition of photosynthesis and growth; however, these effects were transient and fully reversible in the tested species of algae. For all three algal species, no statistically significant reductions (p ≤ 0.05) in growth rate or {PSII} quantum yield were detected at any of the treatment concentrations 48 h after atrazine was removed from the test system. Effects at test levels up to the highest tested exposure levels were consequently determined to be algistatic (reversible). Both biochemically and physiologically, recovery of photosynthesis and growth rate occur immediately, reaching control levels within hours following exposure. Therefore, pulsed exposure profiles of atrazine typically measured in Midwestern U.S. streams are unlikely to result in biologically meaningful changes in primary production given that the effects of atrazine are temporary and fully reversible in species representative of native populations.

Consequently, L. gibba were exposed under various scenarios to atrazine at nominal concentrations ranging from 5 to 160 µg/L and durations of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 14 d under static-renewal test conditions. Exposures were followed by a recovery phase in untreated media for either 7 or 14 d.

No clear effect trends were apparent between exposure duration and the magnitude of effective concentrations ({EC}50s or {EC}10s). No phytocidal effects of chlorosis or necrosis were identified for any treatment scenario. Nearly all L. gibba plants transferred from treatment groups of different exposure scenarios to media without atrazine during the recovery phase had growth rates that demonstrated immediate recovery, indicating effects were phytostatic in nature and reversible. Only the 1- and 5-d exposure scenarios had growth rates indicating marginally prolonged recovery at the higher concentrations (160 µg/L; additionally, at 40 µg/L for the 5-d exposure). Time to recovery, therefore, was found to be largely independent of exposure duration except at the highest concentrations assessed. Based on growth rate by interval, all treatments demonstrated recovery by the final assessment interval (days 5–7), indicating complete recovery in all exposure scenarios by 7 d, consistent with the mode of action of atrazine.

Cadmium was regarded as a model substance to evaluate the usefulness of small-scale laboratory microcosm with microscopic fauna. In particular, effects on the meiofauna community, an ecologically important but rather neglected benthic component, were investigated. In addition, some microfaunal parameters (protozoan abundance and microbial activity) were determined. The sediment was spiked with nominal Cd concentrations of 10, 100, and 1,000 mg/kg dry weight. Because of the strong binding of Cd to sediment particles, measured Cd pore-water concentrations never exceeded 129.5 ± 40.7 µg/L. At 1,000 mg/kg dry weight, the abundances of the two dominant meiofauna taxa, nematodes and oligochaetes, were significantly reduced throughout the present study. Regarding nematodes, species of bacterivorous taxa (Daptonema, Eumonhystera) decreased, whereas species of predacious and omnivorous taxa (Mononchus, Dorylaimus, and Ironus) increased in dominance in microcosms of the highest Cd concentration. Transient effects on microfauna were observed, especially in the first half of the present study, with a reduction in microbial activity and protozoan abundance. However, in microcosms receiving the highest Cd concentration, the abundance of the flagellate Euglena mutabilis increased significantly toward the end of the present study. The results of the present study support the use of small-scale microcosms with natural meiofauna communities as a suitable tool to assess the impact of pollutants in freshwater sediments. Environ.

	abstract = {Under typical agricultural use of an insecticide, it is likely that only part of an edge-of-field drainage ditch will be directly contaminated by spray drift. The response, including recovery, of aquatic macroinvertebrates in sprayed ditch sections may be affected by immigration of organisms from adjacent nonsprayed ditch sections, but also the population dynamics in nonsprayed sections (refuges) may be affected by nearby contaminated patches (known as action at a distance). Experimental ditches were used to study the influence of the presence of nearby refuges on the responses of macroinvertebrates in ditch sections directly sprayed with the insecticide lufenuron, and vice versa. The treatment regimes differed in the proportion of the ditch (0, 33, 67, and 100\% of surface area) that was sprayed to reach a lufenuron concentration of 3 mu g/L in the water column of the sprayed ditch section. In sprayed ditch sections, clear treatment-related effects were observed for adult midges in the emergence traps and for aquatic arthropods (mainly juveniles) in the artificial substrate/sweep net samples. The extent in magnitude and duration of effects in sprayed ditch sections was overall larger when a larger proportion of the ditch was sprayed and/or the distance to the refuge was larger. In nonsprayed ditch sections of partially treated ditches, treatment-related effects were absent or minor for macroinvertebrates that predominantly dwell on or in the sediment compartment, particularly at a larger distance from the sprayed ditch sections. More mobile arthropods that predominantly dwell in the water column showed clear treatment-related effects in the nonsprayed ditch sections as well, but action at a distance was smaller if a smaller proportion of ditch was treated.

	abstract = {In ecotoxicology, appreciation is growing for the influence that ecological interactions have on the toxicity of contaminants, such as insecticides, to sensitive species. Most previous studies, however, have focused on factors that exacerbate insecticide effects on species, while factors that may mitigate these effects have been relatively ignored. In aquatic habitats, a small number of studies have shown that submersed macrophytes can remove some insecticides from the water column via sorption. Although examining sorption dynamics is important for understanding the environmental fate of insecticides, whether and to what extent macrophytes actually mitigate insecticide effects on aquatic species remains unknown. In the present study, the authors examined how much and how quickly several realistic densities of the macrophyte Elodea canadensis decreased the toxicity of the insecticide malathion to Daphnia magna, a keystone aquatic herbivore. To do this, the authors quantified Daphnia survival in outdoor test systems (0.95 L) exposed to a factorial combination of five Elodea densities crossed with five malathion concentrations. The authors discovered that malathion's lethality to Daphnia decreased with increasing Elodea density. Furthermore, the rate at which Elodea reduced malathion's toxicity in the water column increased with macrophyte density. These results provide strong evidence that submersed macrophytes can mitigate the ecological impacts of a popular insecticide and further support that ecological interactions can strongly influence contaminant environmental effects.

	abstract = {Sediments have a major role in ecosystem functioning but can also act as physical or chemical stressors. Anthropogenic activities may change the chemical constituency of sediments and the rate, frequency, and extent of sediment transport, deposition, and resuspension. The importance of sediments as stressors will depend on site ecosystem attributes and the magnitude and preponderance of co-occurring stressors. Contaminants are usually of greater ecological consequence in human-modified, depositional environments, where other anthropogenic stressors often co-occur. Risk assessments and restoration strategies should better consider the role of chemical contamination in the context of multiple stressors. There have been numerous advances in the temporal and spatial characterization of stressor exposures and quantification of biological responses. Contaminated sediments causing biological impairment tend to be patchy, whereas more pervasive anthropogenic stressors, such as alterations to habitat and flow, physical disturbance, and nutrient addition, may drive large-scale ecosystem responses. A systematic assessment of relevant ecosystem attributes and reference conditions can assist in understanding the importance of sediments in the context of other stressors. Experimental manipulations then allow for the controlled study of dominant stressors and the establishment of causal links. This approach will result in more effective management of watersheds and waterways. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:2625–2643. © 2010 {SETAC}},

	abstract = {Ecotoxicological information for most contaminants is limited to a small number of taxa, and these are generally restricted to comparatively hardy organisms that are readily extractable from test media and easily identifiable. Advances in {DNA} sequencing can now provide a comprehensive view of benthic invertebrate diversity. The authors applied 454 pyrosequencing to examine the responses of benthic communities in microcosms exposed to sediments with elevated concentrations of triclosan, the endpoint being eukaryl communities that have successfully vertically migrated through the manipulated sediments. The biological communities associated with the 3 treatments (control triclosan, low triclosan [14 mg/kg], and high triclosan [180 mg/kg]) clustered into 3 groups: control/low (n = 6 controls and 4 low), moderate (n = 2 low), and high (n = 5 high). One sample was discarded as an outlier. The most pronounced change as a response to triclosan was the loss of number of metazoan operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}), indicative of the control/low and moderate groups, with this being most evident in the range of taxa associated with the classes Chromadorea and Bivalvia and the phylum Kinorhyncha. The authors also describe a range of other taxa that aided discrimination between the groups; compare findings with traditionally obtained meio- and macrofaunal communities obtained from the same experiment; and illustrate some of the advantages and limitations associated with both the molecular and traditional approaches. The described approach illustrates the capacity for amplicon sequencing to provide ecologically relevant information that can be used to strengthen an understanding of how sedimentary communities respond to a range of environmental stressors.

Intensive sampling allowed characterization of doses achieved at multiple downstream locations, and concurrent application of rhodamine dye allowed quantification of dispersion, adsorption, and dilution processes. The target dose of 10 to 20 mg Cu/L for 60 min was achieved at least 0.9 km downstream at sites with contrasting levels of didymo mat development. Adsorptive losses of Gemex were 12\%/km where didymo was mostly nonvisible and approximately 36\%/km where substantial didymo mats were present. At 0.9 km downstream, Cu concentrations peaked at 12 mg/L, and didymo was {\textless}5\% viable (down from 65–72\%) for ≥21 d posttreatment. Viability data indicate that elimination of nonvisible infestations is possible and that suppression of early-stage infestations (≤40\% cover, ≤4.5 mm thick) could be achieved after repeated applications. After a single Gemex application, no significant accumulation of Cu was noted in the sediments six weeks posttreatment, but Cu concentrations remained high in algal mats (109–367 mg/kg dry wt). Long-term effects on the nontarget algal, invertebrate, or fish communities were minimal, although significant localized trout mortalities, not predicted by prior laboratory exposures, occurred on the treatment day. Extended Gemex exposure in low-hardness waters might have caused the mortalities, although changes in chelated Cu speciation also possibly contributed.

	abstract = {Sediment quality values ({SQV}) are commonly used—and misused—to characterize the need for investigation, understand causes of observed effects, and derive management strategies to protect benthic invertebrates from direct toxic effects. The authors compiled more than 40 {SQVs} for mercury, nearly all of which are “co-occurrence” {SQVs} derived from databases of paired chemistry and benthic invertebrate effects data obtained from field-collected sediment. Co-occurrence {SQVs} are not derived in a manner that reflects cause–effect, concentration–response relationships for individual chemicals such as mercury, because multiple potential stressors often co-occur in the data sets used to derive {SQVs}. The authors assembled alternative data to characterize mercury-specific effect thresholds, including results of 7 laboratory studies with mercury-spiked sediments and 23 studies at mercury-contaminated sites (e.g., chloralkali facilities, mercury mines). The median (± interquartile range) co-occurrence {SQVs} associated with a lack of effects (0.16 mg/kg [0.13–0.20 mg/kg]) or a potential for effects (0.88 mg/kg [0.50–1.4 mg/kg]) were orders of magnitude lower than no-observed-effect concentrations reported in mercury-spiked toxicity studies (3.3 mg/kg [1.1–9.4 mg/kg]) and mercury site investigations (22 mg/kg [3.8–66 mg/kg]). Additionally, there was a high degree of overlap between co-occurrence {SQVs} and background mercury levels. Although {SQVs} are appropriate only for initial screening, they are commonly misused for characterizing or managing risks at mercury-contaminated sites. Spiked sediment and site data provide more appropriate and useful alternative information for characterization and management purposes. Further research is recommended to refine mercury effect thresholds for sediment that address the bioavailability and causal effects of mercury exposure.

Known targets of these toxins, which typically occur at detrimental concentrations during harmful algal blooms, include voltage-gated ion channels in humans and other mammals. However, the effects of the toxins on the co-occurring phytoplankton community remain unknown. The present study examined the molecular mechanisms of the model photosynthetic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in response to saxitoxin exposure as a means of gaining insight into the phytoplankton community response to a bloom. Previous work with yeast indicated that saxitoxin inhibited copper uptake, so experiments were designed to examine whether saxitoxin exhibited a similar mode of action in algae. Expression profiling following exposure to saxitoxin or a copper chelator produced similar profiles in copper homeostasis genes, notably induction of the cytochrome c6 ({CYC}6) and copper transporter ({COPT}1, {CTR}1) genes. Cytochrome c6 is used as an alternative to plastocyanin under conditions of copper deficiency, and immunofluorescence data showed this protein to be present in a significantly greater proportion of saxitoxin-exposed cells compared to controls. Live-cell imaging with a copper-sensor probe for intracellular labile Cu(I) confirmed that saxitoxin blocked copper uptake. Extrapolations of these data to phytoplankton metabolic processes along with the copper transporter as a molecular target of saxitoxin based on existing structural models are discussed.

	abstract = {Understanding whether and to what extent ecosystem functions respond to chemicals is a major challenge in environmental toxicology. The available data gathered by ecosystem-level experiments (micro- and mesocosms) often describe the responses of taxa densities to stress. However, whether these responses are proportional to the responses of associated ecosystem functions to stress is unclear. By combining a carbon budget modeling technique with data from a standardized microcosm experiment with a known community composition, we quantified three ecosystem functions (net primary production [{NPP}], net mesozooplankton production [{NZP}], and net bacterial production [{NBP}]) at three Cu concentrations, with a control. Changes of these ecosystem functions with increasing chemical concentrations were not always proportional to the Cu effects on the densities of the contributing functional groups. For example, Cu treatments decreased mesozooplankton density by 100-fold and increased phytoplankton density 10- to 100-fold while increasing {NZP} and leaving {NPP} unaltered. However, in contrast, Cu affected microzooplankton and the associated function ({NBP}) in a comparable way. We illustrate that differences in the response of phytoplankton/mesozooplankton densities and the associated ecosystem functions to stress occur because functional rates (e.g., photosynthesis rates/ingestion rates) vary among Cu treatments and in time. These variations could be explained by food web ecology but not by direct Cu effects, indicating that ecology may be a useful basis for understanding environmental effects of stressors. Environ.

	abstract = {Ecological risk assessments of chemicals can be informed by a suite of effect models, including population and food web models. In the risk assessments conducted under {EU} regulation 793/93/{EC}, however, applications of such effect models are extremely scarce and toxicity-extrapolation approaches are often used instead. The objective of the present study was to re-evaluate these risk assessments using two types of effect models: species sensitivity distributions ({SSDs}, non-mechanistic), and food web models (mechanistic). Species sensitivity distributions significantly fitted the available toxicity data for up to 35\% of the chemicals, depending on the trophic levels included and the amount of data available. Median hazardous concentrations for 5\% of the species ({HC}5-50) estimated by the {SSDs} were less accurate predictors of measured community-level no observed effect concentration than food web model-derived {HC}5-50s, albeit data were available for seven chemicals only. For datasets with more than 10 data points, the 90\% confidence interval of the estimated {HC}5s was narrower for the food web modeling approach than for the {SSD} approach. The {HC}5-50s predicted by the two approaches were two to five times (metals) and 10 to 100 times (organic chemicals) higher than the predicted no effect concentrations ({PNECs}) for the aquatic environment listed in the risk assessment reports. This suggests that the derived {PNECs} are protective for aquatic ecosystems. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2013;32:594–601. © 2012 {SETAC}},

However, standard protocols for ecological risk assessments use endpoints that are not directly related to biodiversity. In the present study, the changes in five biodiversity indicators, namely, the Hill, Shannon-Wiener, Simpson's diversity index, {AZTI}'s Marine Benthic Index ({AMBI}), and Benthic Quality Index ({BQI}), are calculated in case species experience direct chemical effects. This is done for an uncontaminated situation as well as for situations in which the effect concentration of a certain fraction of species (x\%) is exceeded, that is, at the hazardous concentration ({HCx}) of the species sensitivity distribution ({SSD}) of the considered community. Results indicate that the response of the biodiversity indicators to concentrations spanning the complete concentration range of the {SSD} is variable. This response depends mainly on the type of indicator, the species assemblage, and the ratio of the slope of the concentration effect curves of the species and the slope of the {SSD}. At the {HC}5, a commonly used threshold in environmental risk assessment, biodiversity indicators, are affected at a marginal level (change is less than 5\% in 99.6\% of the simulated cases). Based on the results, the {HC}5 level is likely to be a protective threshold for changes in biodiversity in terms of richness and heterogeneity in the vast majority of the simulated cases (99.6\%) for chemicals for which direct effects are dominant.

The causes for extirpations have been elusive, although habitat alteration appears to be a major factor. Pesticides have been implicated in declines in western amphibians, but no mechanism has been identified. We tested the hypothesis that leopard frog tadpoles would be eliminated from insecticide-exposed ponds when they were less abundant than a competitor (American toads, Bufo americanus) by manipulating toad and leopard frog density (16, 50, or 150 of each species) with or without the insecticide carbaryl. Insecticide exposure did not interact with density on either species, indicating that contaminant effects were similar despite drastic differences in competition. The survival of both species decreased with increasing conspecific density, but not heterospecific density. Leopard frogs produced more metamorphs at intermediate densities, whereas toads produced more metamorphs at high density. Leopard frog mass at and time to metamorphosis responded negatively to density. Carbaryl did not affect leopard frog survival but positively affected mass at and time to metamorphosis. In contrast, toad survival was reduced after exposure, but mass at metamorphosis was greater. Pesticide-induced survival reductions may not affect population size if reductions are slight (as in toads, whose fitness may be compensated by increased mass). Management strategies aimed at ameliorating the effects of carbaryl in systems with these two species may not need to consider density. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011; 30:650–658. © 2011 {SETAC}},

	abstract = {Tree species composition can change as a result of succession, climate change, fire suppression, and invasive species. These changes clearly affect forests, but they can also affect aquatic ecosystems based on differences in the input quality of leaf litter, such as plant secondary compounds. These compounds vary in type and concentration depending on species and can be toxic to aquatic organisms. To examine toxic effects on Pseudacris maculata and Pseudacris crucifer tadpoles, we conducted 60-d laboratory experiments to compare leaf litter leachate from a dominant canopy species (red oak) and nonnative species (white pine) with an aquatic grass (prairie cordgrass) and plain water control. An additional experiment examined the effects of white pine on Bufo americanus, Hyla versicolor, and tannin concentrations in natural ponds. Compared with the control and grass, tree leaf extracts resulted in reduced tadpole survival. Leached compounds from pine reduced tadpole survival to 3 d or less. Tadpoles were able to metamorphose in significant numbers only from the two controls. The lowered survival with the red oak treatment might have been caused by lowered dissolved oxygen or high tannin concentrations. However, pine is known to have high concentrations of toxic monoterpenes, which should be investigated further. We found that tannin concentrations in natural ponds were much lower than the test concentrations, indicating that these results may represent worst-case scenarios or unrealistic concentrations.

	abstract = {Herbicides are commonly used in agriculture and silviculture to reduce interspecific competition among plants and thereby enhance crop growth, quality, and volume. Internationally, glyphosate-based herbicides are the most widely used herbicides in both of these sectors. Laboratory and mesocosm studies have demonstrated that some formulations are toxic to amphibian larvae below concentrations that approximate predicted maximal or “worst-case” exposure scenarios. However, field studies have not found evidence of toxicity at these concentrations. The authors conducted a replicated field experiment involving 10 naturalized wetlands split in half with an impermeable plastic barrier to assess the direct toxicity of a glyphosate formulation commonly used in silviculture ({VisionMAX}™). The herbicide formulation was applied directly to the surface of one side of each wetland at one of two target aqueous exposure rates (high = 2,880, low = 550 µg acid equivalents [a.e.]/L), and the other side was left as an untreated control. The survival and growth of green frog larvae (Lithobates clamitans) were assessed for two years following herbicide treatment. The herbicide did not have a negative impact on survival or growth of L. clamitans larvae at either treatment level. In fact, mean larval abundance was typically greater in the treated sides than in control sides within the year of herbicide application. These results indicate that typical silviculture use of {VisionMAX} poses negligible risk to larval amphibians, likely because the combined effects of sorption and degradation in natural wetlands limit the exposure magnitude and duration.

In the present study, impacts of timing of rainfall events following carbendazim application on earthworms were investigated. Lumbricus terrestris were maintained in soil columns to which carbendazim and then deionized water (a rainfall substitute) were applied. Carbendazim was applied at 4 kg/ha, the rate recommended in pesticide field trials. Three rainfall regimes were investigated: initial and delayed heavy rainfall 24 h and 6 d after carbendazim application, and frequent rainfall every 48 h. Earthworm mortality and movement of carbendazim through the soil was assessed 14 d after carbendazim application. No detectable movement of carbendazim occurred through the soil in any of the treatments or controls. Mortality in the initial heavy and frequent rainfall was significantly higher (approximately 55\%) than in the delayed rainfall treatment (approximately 25\%). This was due to reduced bioavailability of carbendazim in the latter treatment due to a prolonged period of sorption of carbendazim to soil particles before rainfall events. The impact of carbendazim application on earthworm surface activity was assessed using video cameras. Carbendazim applications significantly reduced surface activity due to avoidance behavior of the earthworms. Surface activity reductions were least in the delayed rainfall treatment due to the reduced bioavailability of the carbendazim. The nature of rainfall events' impacts on the response of earthworms to carbendazim applications, and details of rainfall events preceding and following applications during field trials should be made at a higher level of resolution than is currently practiced according to standard International Organization for Standardization protocols.

The 2 sets of pesticide combinations tested are typical for orchard and tuber crops in The Netherlands. Exposure concentrations were predicted using the {FOCUS} step 3 modeling framework and the Dutch drainage ditch scenario. Recovery times were assessed using the {MASTEP} population model. We simulated the population dynamics and pesticide effects in a Monte Carlo style by using median effective concentration values drawn from an arthropod species sensitivity distribution. In the tuber scenario, exposure to λ-cyhalothrin resulted in long-term effects, whereas exposure to the co-occurring compound fluazinam hardly resulted in (additional) effects. In the orchard scenario, 3 pesticides resulted in large effects just after exposure, but pulse exposures to these compounds did not coincide. The probabilities of effects for the single compounds added up for the combination; in contrast, the recovery times were not higher for the combination compared to those associated with exposure to the individual compounds. The conclusion from the present study's simulations is that exposure to the evaluated pesticide packages may lead to increased mortality probabilities and effect sizes of the combination, but does not lead to longer recovery times for populations with synchronized reproduction than when exposed to the individual compounds.

In the present study, we developed an individual-based model of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex to evaluate the consequences of exposure to 4 compounds with different modes of action on individual survival and population recovery. Effects on survival were calculated using concentration–effect relationships and the threshold damage model ({TDM}), which accounts for detailed processes of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. Delayed effects as calculated by the {TDM} had a significant impact on individual survival and population recovery. We also evaluated the standard assessment of effects after short-term exposures using the 96-h concentration–effect model and the {TDM}, which was conservative for very short-term exposure. An integration of a {TKTD} submodel with a population model can be used to explore the ecological relevance of ecotoxicity endpoints in different exposure environments.

Previous mesocosm studies have focused on dissolved-copper exposures in the overlying waters, which, because of altered exposure pathways, may not accurately predict the effects of copper exposure on invertebrate communities at historically contaminated sites. The present study assessed the effects of copper on the establishment of invertebrate communities within a large outdoor pond mesocosm facility containing environmentally relevant copper-spiked sediments. High particulate copper concentrations ({\textgreater}400 mg/kg dry wt) caused a pronounced effect on the benthic community richness, abundance, and structure in the mesocosms, but particulate copper concentrations below 100 mg/kg dry weight had no effect. Furthermore, there were no effects of copper on the invertebrate communities within the water column, even in the highest copper treatment. The response of the benthic community to copper was influenced by interspecific interactions, the stage of ecological succession, and interspecies variation in sensitivity to copper. The present study demonstrates the importance of using environmentally realistic exposure scenarios that provide both particulate and dissolved exposure pathways. It also emphasizes that risk assessments for aquatic ecosystems should consider the influence of interspecific interactions and interspecies variation in driving the biotic response to contamination.

	abstract = {Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are known to alter the fitness of individual organisms via changes in growth, behavior, and reproduction. It is largely unknown, however, whether these effects cascade through the food web and indirectly affect other, less sensitive organisms. The authors present results from a mesocosm experiment whereby the effects of the synthetic estrogen 17α-ethinylestradiol ({EE}2) were quantified in pelagic communities. Treatment with {EE}2 at a concentration of 28 ng/L had no large effects on the pelagic communities composed only of phytoplankton and zooplankton. In communities where planktivorous roach (Rutilus rutilus) were also present, however, {EE}2 caused a significant reduction in fish biomass. Moreover, zooplankton biomass was higher in the {EE}2 treatments, suggesting that zooplankton may have been released from fish predation. Hence, the direct effect of {EE}2 on roach may have cascaded down the food web to produce positive indirect effects on zooplankton. This result was supported in complementary foraging experiments with roach, showing reduced foraging performance after exposure to {EE}2. Despite the observed negative effect of {EE}2 on roach and the positive indirect effect on zooplankton, these effects did not cascade to phytoplankton, possibly because only copepods, but not cladocerans—the major grazers in these systems—were released from fish predation. The authors conclude that the known reproductive impairment in fish by {EE}2 in combination with the disturbed foraging performance observed in the present study may be a disadvantage to fish that may result in increasing abundance or biomass of prey such as zooplankton. Hence, {EE}2 may have consequences for both the structure and function of freshwater communities. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:930–936. © 2014 {SETAC}},

The effects of biological and chemical stressors on this system therefore also change temporally. In the present short communication, we emphasize the importance of including time as a factor in stress ecology and ecotoxicology and argue that current standard test protocols may benefit considerably from this, improving data interpretation and thus also risk assessment and risk management.

	abstract = {Triclosan (5-chloro-2-[2,4-dichlorophenoxy]phenol) is a relatively new, commonly used antimicrobial compound found in many personal care products. Triclosan is toxic to marine organisms at the micrograms per liter level, can photodegrade to a dioxin, can accumulate in humans, and has been found to be stable in marine sediments for over 30 years. To determine the effects of triclosan on marine benthic communities, intact sediment cores were brought into the laboratory and held under flowing seawater conditions. A 2-cm layer of triclosan-spiked sediment was applied to the surface, and after a two-week exposure the meio- and macrofaunal communities were assessed for differences in composition relative to nonspiked cores. A high triclosan treatment (180 mg/kg dry wt) affected both the meio- and the macrobenthic communities. There were no discernible differences with a low-triclosan treatment (14 mg/kg dry wt). This exposure method is effective for testing the benthic community response to sediment contaminants, but improvements should be made with regard to the amount and method of applying the overlying sediment to prevent smothering of fragile benthic organisms.

Biodegradation was assessed in mesocosm experiments with differing fuel amounts (2,000 and 4,000 mg/kg) and with or without inorganic nutrient amendment. Carbon dioxide production was measured daily for 42 d. Aerobic alkane, total hydrocarbon, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ({PAH}) degraders were enumerated in treated and control mesocosms and changes in their abundances were measured weekly. Hydrocarbon mineralization occurred in all treatments. In the inorganic nutrient-amended treatments, the degradation rates were 2.31 and 2.00 times greater in the 2,000 mg/kg diesel and crude oil treatments, respectively, and 3.52 (diesel) and 4.14 (crude) times higher for the fuel types at the 4,000 mg/kg fuel concentrations compared to unamended treatments. Microbial lag phases were short ({\textless}3 d) and alkane and total hydrocarbon degrader numbers increased by five orders of magnitude compared to the uncontaminated treatments within 7 d in most treatments. Hydrocarbon degrader numbers in diesel and in crude oil treatments were similar; however, the {PAH} degraders were more abundant in the crude oil relative to diesel treatment. These findings indicate that hydrocarbon degradation by extant microbial populations in the northern Gulf of Mexico sandy beach environments can be stimulated and enhanced by inorganic nutrient addition.

	abstract = {We conducted field surveys at 25 sites in three Japanese catchments to provide conservative estimates of the safe concentration of zinc (Zn) for the protection of riverine macroinvertebrate diversity. The relationships between the Zn concentration and six macroinvertebrate metrics for taxon richness were determined by using regression analysis; this included a piecewise regression model, where two lines are joined at an unknown point. For each metric the piecewise regression model with a zero slope below a threshold concentration was selected as the best model to explain the influence of Zn. Under the assumption that macroinvertebrate diversity reductions of {\textless}10\% are acceptable, the safe concentrations of Zn were estimated to be 84, 115, 84, 80, 85, and 70 µg/L for total taxon richness, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera ({EPT}) richness, mayfly richness, caddisfly richness, chironomid richness, and estimated total taxon richness at the riffle scale, respectively. These concentrations are more than twice the water quality standard for Zn in Japan (30 µg/L), suggesting that the standard is likely overprotective for macroinvertebrate diversity. Field studies are useful for evaluating the level of protectiveness of safe concentrations (water quality standards) based on individual-level effects from laboratory toxicity tests, and this evaluation process will have a crucial role in implementing more purpose-driven ecological risk managements that aim to protect natural populations and communities.

In the present study, the authors measured 20-d growth and survivorship of larval Neocloeon triangulifer exposed to a gradient of brine salt (mixed {NaCl} and {CaCl}2) concentrations. Daily growth rates were reduced significantly in all salt concentrations above the control (363 µS cm−1) and larvae in treatments with specific conductance {\textgreater}812 µS cm−1 were in comparatively earlier developmental stages (instars) at the end of the experiment. Survivorship declined significantly when specific conductance was {\textgreater}1513 µS cm−1 and the calculated 20-d 50\% lethal concentration was 2866 µS cm−1.

	abstract = {The widespread use of pesticides raises the possibility that non-target organisms might also be affected. To assess this, the traditional approach has been to conduct short-term laboratory experiments spanning a range of lethal concentrations and some longer-duration experiments at sublethal concentrations. While this approach has been very useful, less attention has been paid to the timing of exposure and the impacts of multiple, small exposures versus single, large exposures. We examined the role of application amount, timing, and frequency using outdoor mesocosm communities containing larval amphibians (Rana sylvatica and Bufo americanus) and using a commercial formulation of the herbicide glyphosate (Roundup Original {MAX}®). Consistent with past studies, exposures of up to 3 mg acid equivalent (a.e.)/L caused substantial amphibian death. However, the amount of death was considerably higher when the herbicide was applied earlier in the experiment than later in the experiment. Single, large applications (at different times) had larger effects on tadpole mortality and growth than multiple, small applications (of the same total amount). The results may reflect an acclimation to the herbicide over time. In treatments with high tadpole mortality, there was no resulting increase in periphyton, suggesting that the reduction in tadpole herbivory might have been offset by direct negative impacts of the herbicide. We also discovered that temperature stratification caused herbicide stratification, with higher concentrations near the surface. Such stratification has important implications to the habitat choices of ectotherms that might prefer surface waters for thermoregulation or prefer deeper waters to avoid predators. Collectively, the present study demonstrates the importance of examining multiple applications times and frequencies to understand the impacts of pesticides on organisms. Environ. Toxicol.

	abstract = {Toxicity assessments on nontarget organisms have largely been addressed using short-term, single-species laboratory experiments. Although extremely helpful, these experiments inherently lack many pervasive ecological stressors found in nature. Though a substantial challenge, incorporating these ecological stressors in contaminant studies would shed light on potential synergistic effects. For the world's leading herbicide, glyphosate, we know little about how natural stressors affect the toxicity to nontarget organisms. To explore how the natural stress of competition might interact with a glyphosate-based herbicide, we used outdoor mesocosms containing three tadpole species that were exposed to a factorial combination of three glyphosate concentrations (0, 1, 2, or 3 mg acid equivalent (a.e.)/L of the commercial formulation Roundup Original {MAX}®) and three tadpole densities (low, medium, or high). We found that increased tadpole density caused declines in tadpole growth, but also made the herbicide significantly more lethal to one species. Whereas the median lethal concentration ({LC}50) values were similar across all densities for gray treefrogs (Hyla versicolor; 1.7–2.3 mg a.e./L) and green frogs (Rana clamitans; 2.2–2.6 mg a.e./L), the {LC}50 values for bullfrogs (R. catesbeiana) were 2.1 to 2.2 mg a.e./L at low and medium densities, but declined to 1.6 mg a.e./L at high densities. The large decrease in amphibian survival with increased herbicide concentration was associated with increases in periphyton abundance. We also found evidence that temperature stratification lead to herbicide stratification in the water column, confirming the results of a previous study and raising important questions about exposure risk in natural systems.

In the present study, the authors applied a generic individual-based simulation model of 2 competing species to analyze the consequences of interspecific competition for population dynamics under pulsed contamination. The results indicated that competition that causes a density-dependent decrease in reproduction can substantially prolong the long-term effects of the toxicant. In the example investigated, population recovery time increased from approximately 1 generation time without competition to more than 3 generation times under competition. In particular, species with low reproductive capacity exhibited a strongly prolonged recovery time when interspecific competition was included in the model. The authors conclude that toxicant concentrations derived from risk assessments for pesticides that do not consider competition might be under-protective for populations in real-world systems. The consideration of competition is especially relevant for species with low reproductive capacities to enable a realistic estimation of recovery pace.

In the present study, the authors report the results of an experiment in which they grew three common species of stream algae as monocultures and together as polycultures in the biofilms of stream mesocosms that were exposed to 0, 0.1, or 1.0 ppm nanoparticle titanium dioxide ({nTiO}2). The {nTiO}2 did not alter the growth trajectory of any algal biofilm over 10+ generations. However, Ti accrual in biofilms not only differed among the algal species but was also higher in polycultures than in the average monoculture. Variation in accrual among species compositions was readily predicted by differences in the total biomass achieved by the different biofilms. When biofilms were fed to the herbivorous snail Physa acuta at the end of the experiment, initial concentrations of {nTiO}2 did not alter short-term rates of herbivory. However, because of differences in palatability among the algae, biofilm composition influenced the amount of {nTiO}2 that accumulated in the herbivore tissue. The results have important implications for understanding how efficiently {nTiO}2 is removed from surface waters and the potential transfer of nanomaterials to higher trophic levels. Environ.

A challenge for ecotoxicologists is to predict how joint effects of climatic stress and toxicants measured at the individual level (e.g., reduced survival and reproduction) will be manifested at the population level (e.g., population growth rate, extinction risk) and community level (e.g., species richness, food-web structure). The authors discuss how population- and community-level responses to toxicants under {GCC} are likely to be influenced by various ecological mechanisms. Stress due to {GCC} may reduce the potential for resistance to and recovery from toxicant exposure. Long-term toxicant exposure can result in acquired tolerance to this stressor at the population or community level, but an associated cost of tolerance may be the reduced potential for tolerance to subsequent climatic stress (or vice versa). Moreover, {GCC} can induce large-scale shifts in community composition, which may affect the vulnerability of communities to other stressors. Ecological modeling based on species traits (representing life-history traits, population vulnerability, sensitivity to toxicants, and sensitivity to climate change) can be a promising approach for predicting combined impacts of {GCC} and toxicants on populations and communities.

	abstract = {Several fuel spills have occurred on subantarctic Macquarie Island (54°30′ S 158°57′ E) associated with storing fuel and generating power for the island's research station. The Australian Antarctic Division began full-scale, on-site remediation of these sites in 2009. To develop appropriate target concentrations for remediation, acute and chronic tests were developed with the endemic earthworm, Microscolex macquariensis, using avoidance, survival, and reproduction as endpoints. Uncontaminated low (3\%), medium (11\%), and high (38–48\%) carbon content soils from Macquarie Island were used to examine the influence of soil carbon on toxicity. Soils were spiked with Special Antarctic Blend ({SAB}) diesel and used either immediately to simulate a fresh spill or after four weeks to simulate an aged spill. Earthworms were sensitive to fresh {SAB}, with significant avoidance at 181 mg/kg; acute 14-d survival median lethal concentration ({LC}50) of 103 mg/kg for low carbon soil; and juvenile production median effective concentration ({EC}50) of 317 mg/kg for high carbon soil. Earthworms were less sensitive to aged {SAB} than to fresh {SAB} in high carbon soil for juvenile production ({EC}50 of 1,753 and 317 mg/kg, respectively), but were more sensitive for adult survival ({LC}50 of 2,322 and 1,364 mg/kg, respectively). Using M. macquariensis as a surrogate for soil quality, approximately 50 to 200 mg {SAB}/kg soil would be a sufficiently protective remediation target. Environ. Toxicol.

The author's established a method that allows them to perform exposure assays with resting eggs produced by the Daphnia longispina species complex, key species in large lake ecosystems. A mixture of organic contaminants previously detected in sediments of Lake Greifensee was selected to test the potential effect of organic contaminants present in sediments on the hatching process. Resting eggs were exposed to a mix of 10 chemicals, which included corrosion inhibitors, biocides, pesticides and personal care products, for a period of 15 consecutive days. Using an automated counting software the author's found a significant increase in hatching success in the exposed resting eggs vs. controls. Such an effect has not been reported from ecotoxicological assays with resting eggs so far. Possible mechanistic explanations as well as the potential implications on the ecology and evolution of aquatic species that rely on a resting egg banks are discussed. Observed increased mortality and developmental abnormalities for hatchlings in the exposure treatments can be explained by toxic contaminant concentrations. The authors' study results highlight the need for further studies assessing the effects of organic contaminants on resting egg banks and aquatic ecosystems. This article is protected by copyright.

Among the variety of the phenylurea photoproducts, the N-formylated ones appeared clearly more toxic than the parent compounds towards the microorganisms, whereas the nitroderivatives showed a similar toxicity. Using photodegraded solutions of diuron, toxicity was maintained or even increased during disappearance of the initial herbicide, demonstrating that some of the photoproducts may have an impact additively or in synergy. Enzymatic biomarker assays performed on Lymnaea stagnalis exposed under monospecific conditions showed significant effects, due to the combination of nitrate with the pesticide and its photoproducts. A positive impact on snail fecundity was observed with chlorotoluron both under monospecific laboratory and integrated mesocosm conditions.

It is in treated wastewater effluents at low parts-per-billion concentrations, representing a potentially chronic exposure condition for biota inhabiting receiving streams. For the present study, a naturally colonized benthos was created using flow-through indoor mesocosms; then, the benthic communities were dosed to achieve different in-stream triclosan concentrations (control, 0.1 µg/L, 0.5 µg/L, 1.0 µg/L, 5.0 µg/L, and 10 µg/L) for 56 d. Water quality parameters and endpoints from bacteria to macroinvertebrates, as well as interacting abiotic components, were measured. Effects of triclosan on specific microbial endpoints were observed at all doses, including an effect on litter decomposition dynamics at doses of 1.0 µg/L and higher. Resistance of periphytic bacteria to triclosan significantly increased at doses of 0.5 µg/L and above. By the end of dosing, the antimicrobial appeared to stimulate the stream periphyton at the 3 lowest doses, while the 2 highest doses exhibited decreased stocks of periphyton, including significantly lower bacteria cell densities and cyanobacteria abundance compared with the control. Other than an effect on benthic ostracods, the changes that occurred in the periphyton did not translate to significant change in the colonizing nematodes, the macroinvertebrate community as a whole, or other measurements of stream function. The results shed light on the role a low, chronic exposure to triclosan may play in effluent-dominated streams. Environ Toxicol Chem 2013;32:2874–2887. © 2013 {SETAC}},

	abstract = {The ability of some pulp mill effluents ({PME}) to act as reproductive and endocrine disrupters in fish is well documented in the literature. However, changes are not always consistent with regard to species, gender, hormones, or reproductive effects. In the present study, the presence of the first intersexed fish that, to our knowledge, has been found in a Canadian river exposed to {PME}, is reported. A field survey of the Wabigoon River near Dryden, Ontario, in the fall of 2000 found intersexed walleye (Sander vitreus vitreus) with significantly altered hormone levels and reduced gonad size. The Wabigoon River receives discharge from a bleached kraft pulp and paper mill and a municipal wastewater ({MWW}) plant. It also has historical sediment contamination (wood fiber mats) contributing to extended periods of low dissolved oxygen under low flow, drought conditions. A mesocosm-based partial life cycle test exposing fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to reference water, 20\% effluent volume to river volume (v/v), 40\% (v/v), or 60\% (v/v) {PME} as well as a field survey of the walleye in the Wabigoon River were conducted. The only change in our mesocosm exposure was a decrease in testosterone in males with increasing effluent concentration and vitellogenin induction in males exposed to 60\% (v/v) effluent. These results did not reflect the magnitude of endocrine disruption seen in the wild fish survey. Several hypotheses that may explain these discrepancies are proposed. Specifically, evidence is offered from published studies indicating that either hypoxia or {MWW}, alone or in combination with {PME}, may explain the discrepancy between our field experiment and the wild fish survey. The present study illustrates the complexities of multistressor receiving environments and the need for the development of cumulative effects assessment approaches. Environ. Toxicol.

	abstract = {Pesticide toxicity may be modified by a number of co-occurring environmental and ecological stressors. Coexposure to predator cues has been shown to potentiate and/or synergize toxicity of pesticides. However, the mechanisms behind these interactions are not well understood. Here we examine the effects of fish predator (bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus) cues on toxicity of five different pesticides to the freshwater cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia dubia. The purpose for examining patterns among pesticides was to test the idea that the mechanism of the interaction could be explained by a general stress response; that is, the interaction patterns would be similar regardless of the pesticide's mechanism of action [{MOA}]). Acute 96-h concentration–response experiments were conducted for pesticides with and without fish cues. Predator cues influenced the toxicity of pesticides and the interaction patterns varied among pesticides. Fipronil exhibited a synergistic interaction, while predator cues interacted antagonistically for bifenthrin and thiacloprid. Other compounds previously reported to potentiate toxicity (malathion) were found to act additively. The results demonstrate that factors such as pesticide bioavailability, {KOC}, and exposure concentration may be important for predicting the occurrence of these interactions and that patterns were not consistent among pesticides varying in {MOA}. Predator stress is an important component for structuring communities and ecosystem processes. Fully understanding how this process may interact with organic contaminants may best be achieved by examination at toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic scales.  Environ. Toxicol.

The aim of the present study was to test if this disturbance affected the bioavailability of total mercury ({THg}) and methylmercury ({MeHg}) in surficial sediments to a benthic invertebrate (Echinogammarus ischnus). Ebullition rates ranged from {\textless}1 to 2,800 ml/m2 daily, with methane gas comprising 29 to 84\% of the total. No direct effects of ebullition were found on either abiotic (sediment or pore water {THg} or {MeHg} concentrations) or biotic (amphipod {THg} or {MeHg} concentrations) variables measured. Instead, amphipod {MeHg} concentrations were best predicted by pore water {THg} and {MeHg} concentrations, organic matter of surficial sediments, and water depth and location. Trend surface analyses demonstrated that a shallow, southwestern part of Zone 1 was most contaminated with pore water mercury, which decreased in a gradient toward the northeast. Further study is needed to determine if the amount of sediment resuspended by ebullition affects the spatial distribution of mercury. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2013;32:857–865. © 2013 {SETAC}},

This has been achieved by linking chemical fate and toxicological effects mechanistically, based on internal concentrations, through the tissue residue approach. However, certain questions remain: for example, how do {TK} and {TD} differ among species and how does this relate to differences in species sensitivity? In a series of experiments, we studied the {TK} of [14C]chlorpyrifos in 15 freshwater arthropod species, two of which were studied in juvenile and adult life stages. Uptake (kin) and elimination (kout) rate constants were fitted using a one-compartment single first-order kinetic model. The application of two complementary parameter estimation methods facilitated the calculation of bioconcentration factors ({BCF}) with prediction intervals and 95\% depuration times (t95) for all tested species. Extremely slow elimination was observed in some species as well as high overall variation in kin, kout, {BCF}, and t95 across the tested aquatic arthropod species. This variation has implications for the development of {TKTD} approaches in {ERA}, including assessing fluctuating exposure concentrations and the interpretation of observed toxicity responses in the laboratory and in the field.

To facilitate direct accumulation from the sediment, it was continuously resuspended. To study the dietary bioaccumulation of {PCBs}, cod were fed benthic polychaetes (Nereis virens) previously exposed to test sediments, which were naturally polluted sediments from the inner Oslofjord (Norway). Both exposure experiments had a duration of 129 d. Furthermore, the role of sediments as a source of {PCBs} accumulated in Oslofjord cod was elucidated, using results from environmental monitoring as a reference. Generally, the results suggest that the contaminated sediments of the inner Oslofjord are an important source of legacy {PCBs} for accumulation in resident cod, although additional contributions may also be important. Crude estimates of assimilation efficiency of ingested {PCBs} (through diet) were found to be 30 to 50\%; the highest was for the lower chlorinated congeners ({PCB}-28 and -52). Challenges for applying trophic magnification factors for determining biomagnification in laboratory experiments, in terms of preventive environmental safety, are indicated. The results provide useful information for parameterization of models describing the behavior of hydrophobic persistent contaminants in the foodweb of the Oslofjord and elsewhere. Environ. Toxicol.

	abstract = {Degradation of alkylphenol ethoxylates to more persistent alkylphenols such as nonylphenol occurs in wastewater treatment plants where nonylphenol is released to aquatic systems. In this study, acute and chronic tests were conducted to determine the toxicity and bioconcentration of nonylphenol to freshwater organisms for use in deriving national water quality criteria. Acute median effect concentrations ({EC}50s) based on loss of equilibrium, immobility, and lethality for species representing several taxonomic groups ranged from 21 to 596 µg/L. The {EC}50s were up to a factor of 2 less than median lethal concentrations ({LC}50s) and decreased with time over the test periods of 24 to 96 h. In chronic tests, early life stages of rainbow trout were 14 times more sensitive to nonylphenol than in acute tests and approximately 20 times more sensitive than Daphnia magna exposed over their complete life cycle. Comparisons of chronic test endpoints showed that 20\% effect concentrations ({EC}20s), determined by regression testing, and chronic values, determined by hypothesis testing, were similar for both the rainbow trout and Daphnia magna. The lowest mean tissue–effect concentrations of nonylphenol appeared to be greater for the fathead minnow than bluegill, and ranged from approximately 130 to 160 µg/g after 96-h exposure and from approximately 20 to 90 µg/g after 28-d exposure. Mean lipid normalized bioconcentration factors ({BCFs}) associated with no-effect concentrations were approximately 180 and 50 for the fathead minnow and bluegill, respectively. The present test results suggest that long-term exposures to nonylphenol at concentrations found in some surface waters could adversely impact sensitive components of freshwater communities. Environ.

	abstract = {Differences are often apparent in the observed rates of degradation between laboratory water-sediment studies and outdoor studies in surface water environments. Indeed, previous work has shown that including phototrophic communities in laboratory systems can result in the enhancement of degradation, when compared against systems that exclude phototrophs, incubated in darkness. In phototroph-inclusive systems, a range of metabolic processes and community effects are absent in the standard laboratory systems: metabolism by macrophytes, algae, and periphyton, as well as enhancement of bacterial and fungal communities by macrophyte root structures, algal biofilms, and planktonic algae. Here, the authors demonstrate the metabolic capability of algae and macrophytes in isolation from bacterial and fungal communities. The authors have isolated subcommunities and individual species from complex, phototroph-inclusive test systems, and demonstrated significant degradation of the fungicide fludioxonil in their presence. They have also shown the intrinsic metabolic competence of Elodea canadensis as well as algae from three phyla (Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta, and Bacillariophyta [diatoms]), demonstrating that phototrophic communities have the potential to play a direct role in metabolism in surface water environments. Thus, it seems that current laboratory test systems are failing to consider the role of active, competent organisms that are likely to be involved in the degradation of crop protection products in surface water environments.

The present study shows the effects of the herbicides chlortoluron and mesotrione on three microalgae species: two chlorophyceae (Pediastrum tetras, Ankistrodesmus fusiformis) and one diatom (Amphora coffeaeformis). The authors calculated the {IC}50 for one chlorophyceae and the diatom. The order of toxicity (median inhibitory concentration [{IC}50]) for mesotrione was A. coffeaeformis (13.1 mg/L) {\textgreater} A. fusiformis (56.1 mg/L) and A. fusiformis (0.05 mg/L) {\textgreater} A. coffeaeformis (0.08 mg/L) for chlortoluron. The impact of herbicides applied at 0.2 mg/L was then examined in Erlenmeyer flasks by monitoring for growth, pigment content, and metabolic activity. Algal responses varied widely according to species and herbicide. For example, chlortoluron showed a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of A. coffeaeformis, whereas mesotrione induced an increase in cellular density in A. fusiformis. Other cellular parameters, such as pigment content in P. tetras, were stimulated by both herbicides. The results obtained confirmed that microalgae cultures are clearly affected by acute and chronic exposition to herbicides. Further monitoring should be carried out in the field to assess the impact of sublethal levels of toxicity and the growth-enhancing effects of mesotrione and chlortoluron on natural algae communities.

	volume = {48},
	abstract = {Effects of chronic application of the fungicide {DerosalÆ} (active ingredient carbendazim) were studied in indoor macrophyte-dominated freshwater microcosms. The concentrations (0, 3.3, 33, 100, 330 and 1000 ?g/l) were kept at a constant level for 4 weeks. This paper is the second of a series of two; it describes the effects on zooplankton and primary producers and presents an overall discussion. The zooplankton community was negatively affected by the three highest treatment levels ({NOEC}(community) = 33 ?g/l). At higher treatment levels Cladocera taxa were completely eliminated, while Copepod numbers were reduced. Rotatoria taxa decreased (Keratella quadrata and Lecane sp.) or increased in abundance (Testudinella parva) at the highest treatment level only. Due to the reduced grazing pressure, the abundance of some phytoplankton taxa and the chlorophyll-a content of the phytoplankton increased at the three highest treatment levels ({NOEC}(community) = 33 ?g/l). This effect was not observed for the periphyton, most probably because the reduced grazing pressure was compensated by the increased abundance of some snail species such as Lymnaea stagnalis and Physella acuta. At the end of the experimental period the biomass of the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii was significantly elevated at the two highest treatment levels. It is hypothesised that carbendazim might have caused, directly or indirectly, the removal of pathogene organisms from the macrophyte. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

A critical component of ecosystem function that has not previously been evaluated with respect to freshwater salinization is the impact on organic matter breakdown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate cumulative effects of road deicers and tadpole grazers on leaf litter breakdown rate (g d−1) and microbial respiration (mg O2 g leaf−1 h−1). To test this interaction, in May 2008 the authors added dry leaf litter (Quercus spp.) to forty 600-L pond mesocosms and inoculated each with algae and zooplankton. In a full-factorial design, they manipulated a realistic level of road salt (ambient or elevated at 645 mg L−1 Cl−) and tadpole (Hyla versicolor) presence or absence. The elevated chloride treatment reduced microbial respiration by 24\% in the presence of tadpoles. The breakdown of leaf litter by tadpoles occurred 9.7\% faster under ambient chloride conditions relative to the elevated chloride treatment. Results of the present study suggest that the microbial community is directly impacted by road deicers and heavy tadpole grazing under ambient conditions limits microbial capacity to process detritus. Road salts and tadpoles interact to limit microbial respiration, but to a lesser extent leaf mass loss rate, thereby potentially restricting energy flow from detrital sources in pond ecosystems.

Intended and environmentally relevant test concentrations of azoxystrobin were 0 µg active ingredient (a.i.)/L, 0.33 µg a.i./L, 1 µg a.i./L, 3.3 µg a.i./L, 10 µg a.i./L, and 33 µg a.i./L, kept at constant values. Responses of freshwater populations and community parameters were studied. During the 42-d experimental period, the time-weighted average concentrations of azoxystrobin ranged from 93.5\% to 99.3\% of intended values. Zooplankton, especially copepods and the Daphnia longispina group, were the most sensitive groups. At the population level, a consistent no-observed-effect concentration ({NOEC}) of 1 µg a.i./L was calculated for Copepoda. The {NOEC} at the zooplankton community level was 10 µg azoxystrobin/L. The principle of the European Union pesticide directive is that lower-tier regulatory acceptable concentrations ({RACs}) are protective of higher-tier {RACs}. This was tested for chronic risks from azoxystrobin. With the exception of the microcosm community chronic {RAC} (highest tier), all other chronic {RAC} values were similar to each other (0.5–1 µg a.i./L). The new and stricter first-tier species requirements of the European Union pesticide regulation (1107/2009/{EC}) are not protective for the most sensitive populations in the microcosm study, when based on the higher tier population {RAC}. In comparison, the Water Framework Directive generates environmental quality standards that are 5 to 10 times lower than the derived chronic {RACs}.

	abstract = {Within the framework of European Union chemical legislations an extensive data set on the chronic toxicity of sediment nickel has been generated. In the initial phase of testing, tests were conducted with 8 taxa of benthic invertebrates in 2 nickel-spiked sediments, including 1 reasonable worst-case sediment with low concentrations of acid-volatile sulfide ({AVS}) and total organic carbon. The following species were tested: amphipods (Hyalella azteca, Gammarus pseudolimnaeus), mayflies (Hexagenia sp.), oligochaetes (Tubifex tubifex, Lumbriculus variegatus), mussels (Lampsilis siliquoidea), and midges (Chironomus dilutus, Chironomus riparius). In the second phase, tests were conducted with the most sensitive species in 6 additional spiked sediments, thus generating chronic toxicity data for a total of 8 nickel-spiked sediments. A species sensitivity distribution was elaborated based on 10\% effective concentrations yielding a threshold value of 94 mg Ni/kg dry weight under reasonable worst-case conditions. Data from all sediments were used to model predictive bioavailability relationships between chronic toxicity thresholds (20\% effective concentrations) and {AVS} and Fe, and these models were used to derive site-specific sediment-quality criteria. Normalization of toxicity values reduced the intersediment variability in toxicity values significantly for the amphipod species Hyalella azteca and G. pseudolimnaeus, but these relationships were less clearly defined for the mayfly Hexagenia sp. Application of the models to prevailing local conditions resulted in threshold values ranging from 126 mg to 281 mg Ni/kg dry weight, based on the {AVS} model, and 143 mg to 265 mg Ni/kg dry weight, based on the Fe model.

	abstract = {Use of glyphosate-based herbicides is increasing worldwide. The authors review the available data related to potential impacts of these herbicides on amphibians and conduct a qualitative meta-analysis. Because little is known about environmental concentrations of glyphosate in amphibian habitats and virtually nothing is known about environmental concentrations of the substances added to the herbicide formulations that mainly contribute to adverse effects, glyphosate levels can only be seen as approximations for contamination with glyphosate-based herbicides. The impact on amphibians depends on the herbicide formulation, with different sensitivity of taxa and life stages. Effects on development of larvae apparently are the most sensitive endpoints to study. As with other contaminants, costressors mainly increase adverse effects. If and how glyphosate-based herbicides and other pesticides contribute to amphibian decline is not answerable yet due to missing data on how natural populations are affected. Amphibian risk assessment can only be conducted case-specifically, with consideration of the particular herbicide formulation. The authors recommend better monitoring of both amphibian populations and contamination of habitats with glyphosate-based herbicides, not just glyphosate, and suggest including amphibians in standardized test batteries to study at least dermal administration.

We show that none of the data distributions are normal and that for typical sample sizes of N{\textless}20 it is very unlikely to detect deviations from normality.

For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects).

	abstract = {A flow-through system was developed to investigate the effects of time-variable exposure of pesticides on algae. A recently developed algae population model was used for simulations supported and verified by laboratory experiments. Flow-through studies with Desmodesmus subspicatus and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata under time-variable exposure to isoproturon were performed, in which the exposure patterns were based on the results of {FOrum} for Co-ordination of pesticide fate models and their {USe} ({FOCUS}) model calculations for typical exposure situations via runoff or drain flow. Different types of pulsed exposure events were realized, including a whole range of repeated pulsed and steep peaks as well as periods of constant exposure. Both species recovered quickly in terms of growth from short-term exposure and according to substance dissipation from the system. Even at a peak 10 times the maximum predicted environmental concentration of isoproturon, only transient effects occurred on algae populations. No modified sensitivity or reduced growth was observed after repeated exposure. Model predictions of algal growth in the flow-through tests agreed well with the experimental data. The experimental boundary conditions and the physiological properties of the algae were used as the only model input. No calibration or parameter fitting was necessary. The combination of the flow-through experiments with the algae population model was revealed to be a powerful tool for the assessment of pulsed exposure on algae. It allowed investigating the growth reduction and recovery potential of algae after complex exposure, which is not possible with standard laboratory experiments alone. The results of the combined approach confirm the beneficial use of population models as supporting tools in higher-tier risk assessments of pesticides. Environ. Toxicol.

	abstract = {Multiple stressor scenarios, as they are relevant in many watersheds, call for approaches extending beyond conventional chemical-focused approaches. The present study, investigated the fish population, represented by chub (Leuciscus cephalus), in the Bílina River (Czech Republic), which is impacted by various pollution sources and might pose a risk on the fish population. To confirm or reject this hypothesis it was examined whether there exists an association between abundance of chub and exposure to toxic chemicals as well as natural stressors, represented by parasites, and whether health-related suborganismal traits, namely, organ indices, tissue histopathology, and immune parameters, would help in revealing relationships between stressor impact and population status. Toxic pressure was assessed by the toxic unit approach, which gives an integrative estimate of toxic effect concentrations and by measuring the biomarkers cytochrome P4501A and vitellogenin, which indicate exposure to bioavailable arylhydrocarbon- or estrogen receptor ligands. Parasite pressure was estimated by determining abundance and species composition of ecto- and endoparasites of chub. Chub abundance was high upstream in the Bílina, low to zero in the middle stretches, and increased again downstream. Toxic pressure increased in the downstream direction, while parasite intensity decreased in this direction. Health status of chub did not differ clearly between up-, middle-, and downstream sites. Thus, it appears that neither toxic pressure nor parasite pressure nor their combination translates into a change of chub health status. By using varied assessment tools, this study provides evidence against a presumed causative role of toxicants impairing the fish ecological status of the Bílina River. Environ. Toxicol.

	abstract = {After the significant population decline of several pelagic fish species in the Northern Sacramento–San Joaquin ({SSJ}) Estuary ({CA}, {USA}) in 2002, a study was performed to monitor water column toxicity using the amphipod Hyalella azteca. From January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2007, water samples were collected biweekly from 15 to 16 sites located in large delta channels and main-stem rivers, selected based on prevalent distribution patterns of fish species of concern. Ten-day laboratory tests with H. azteca survival and relative growth as toxicity endpoints were conducted. The enzyme inhibitor piperonyl butoxide ([{PBO}], 25 µg/L) was added to synergize or antagonize pyrethroid or organophosphate ({OP}) insecticide toxicity, respectively. Significant amphipod mortality was observed in 5.6\% of ambient samples. Addition of {PBO} significantly changed survival or growth in 1.1\% and 10.1\% of ambient samples, respectively. Sites in the Lower Sacramento River had the largest number of acutely toxic samples, high occurrence of {PBO} effects on amphipod growth (along with sites in the South Delta), and the highest total ammonia/ammonium concentrations (0.28 ± 0.15 mg/L). Ammonia/ammonium, or contaminants occurring in mixture with these, likely contributed to the observed toxicity. Pyrethroid insecticides were detected at potentially toxic concentrations. Overall, results of this study identified specific areas and contaminants of concern and showed that water in the Northern {SSJ} Estuary was at times acutely toxic to sensitive invertebrates.

The abundance and aromaticity of the chromophoric {DOM} increased over the 25-d mesocosm experiment. The {BPA} freely dissolved concentration was 72.3\% lower and the chloramphenicol freely dissolved concentration was 56.2\% lower using {DOM} collected on day 25 than using {DOM} collected on day 1 of the mesocosm experiment. The freely dissolved concentrations negatively correlated with the ultraviolent absorption coefficient at 254 nm and positively correlated with the spectral slope of chromophoric {DOM}, suggesting that the bioavailability of these emerging organic contaminants depends on the characteristics of the {DOM} present. The {DOM}–water partition coefficients (log {KOC}) for the emerging organic contaminants positively correlated with the aromaticity of the {DOM}, measured as humic acid–like fluorescent components C1 (excitation/emission = 250[313]/412 nm) and C2 (excitation/emission = 268[379]/456 nm).

	abstract = {Conflict between native amphibians and aquatic weed management in the Pacific Northwest is rarely recognized because most native stillwater-breeding amphibian species move upland during summer, when herbicide application to control weeds in aquatic habitats typically occurs. However, aquatic weed management may pose a risk for aquatic species present in wetlands through the summer, such as the Oregon spotted frog ({OSF}, Rana pretiosa), a state endangered species in Washington. Acute toxicity of herbicides used to control aquatic weeds tends to be low, but the direct effects of herbicide tank mixes on {OSFs} have remained unexamined. We exposed juvenile {OSFs} to tank mixes of the herbicide imazapyr, a surfactant, and a marker dye in a 96-h static-renewal test. The tank mix was chosen because of its low toxicity to fish and its effectiveness in aquatic weed control. Concentrations were those associated with low-volume (3.5 L/ha) and high-volume (7.0 L/ha) applications of imazapyr and a clean-water control. Following exposure, frogs were reared for two months in clean water to identify potential latent effects on growth. Endpoints evaluated included feeding behavior, growth, and body and liver condition indices. We recorded no mortalities and found no significant differences for any end point between the herbicide-exposed and clean-water control frogs. The results suggest that imazapyr use in wetland restoration poses a low risk of direct toxic effects on juvenile {OSFs}. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2013;32:228–235. © 2012 {SETAC}},

	abstract = {The San Francisco Bay (California, {USA}) is a water body listed as impaired because of Hg contamination in sport fish for human consumption, as well as possible effects on resident wildlife. A legacy of Hg mining in local watersheds and Hg used in Au mining in the Sierra Nevada ({USA}) has contributed to contamination seen in the bay, with additional more recent and ongoing inputs from various sources. Methylmercury is the species of Hg most directly responsible for contamination in biota, so better understanding of its sources, loads, and processes was sought to identify the best means to reduce impacts. A regional scale model of San Francisco Bay was developed to characterize major methylmercury inputs and processes. The model was used to evaluate the potential impact of uncertainties in estimates for methylmercury loading pathways and environmental processes, identify major data gaps, and explore management prospects for reducing methylmercury contamination. External loading pathways considered in the mass balance include methylmercury loads entering via atmospheric deposition to the bay surface, and discharges from the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta, local watersheds, municipal wastewater, and fringing wetlands. Internal processes considered include exchange between bed and suspended sediments and the water column, in situ production and demethylation, biological uptake, and losses via hydrologic transport to the ocean through the Golden Gate. In situ sediment methylation and demethylation were dominant sources and losses determining ambient steady-state concentrations in the model, with changes in external loads and export causing smaller changes. Better information on methylation and demethylation is thus most critical to improving understanding of methylmercury balances and management. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:88–96. © 2010 {SETAC}},

	abstract = {The present study compared the effects of different time-variable exposure regimes having the same time-weighted average ({TWA}) concentration of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos on freshwater invertebrate communities to enable extrapolation of effects across exposure regimes. The experiment was performed in outdoor microcosms by introducing three different regimes: a single application of 0.9 µg active ingredients (a.i.)/L; three applications of 0.3 µg a.i./L, with a time interval of 7 d; and continuous exposure to 0.1 µg a.i./L for 21 d. Measurements showed that the {TWA}21d concentration in the continuous-exposure treatment (0.098 µg/L) was slightly lower than in the three-application (0.116 µg/L) and single-application (0.126 µg/L) treatments. The application of chlorpyrifos resulted in decreased abundances in the arthropod community, with the largest adverse effects reported for the mayfly Cloeon dipterum and cladocerans Daphnia gr. longispina and Alona sp., while smaller effects were observed for other insects, copepods, and amphipods. At the population level, however, the mayfly C. dipterum only responded to the single-application treatment, which could be explained by the toxicokinetics of chlorpyrifos in this species. At the end of the experimental period the invertebrate community showed approximately the same effect magnitude for all treatment regimes. These results suggest that for this combination of concentrations and duration of the {TWA}, the {TWA} concentration is more important for most species than the peak concentration for the assessment of long-term risks of chlorpyrifos.
