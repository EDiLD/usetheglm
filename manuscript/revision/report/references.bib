Young daphnids, aged less than 24 hours at the start of the test, are exposed to the test substance at a range of concentrations (at least five concentrations) for a period of 48 hours. Immobilisation is recorded at 24 hours and 48 hours and compared with control values. The results are analysed in order to calculate the EC50 at 48h. Determination of the EC50 at 24h is optional. At least 20 animals, preferably divided into four groups of five animals each, should be used at each test concentration and for the controls. At least 2 ml of test solution should be provided for each animal (i.e. a volume of 10 ml for five daphnids per test vessel). The limit test corresponds to one dose level of 100 mg/L. The study report should include the observation for immobilized daphnids at 24 and 48 hours after the beginning of the test and the measures of dissolved oxygen, pH, concentration of the test substance, at the beginning and end of the test.},

It begins by demonstrating the fundamentals of modeling count data, including a thorough presentation of the Poisson model. It then works up to an analysis of the problem of overdispersion and of the negative binomial model, and finally to the many variations that can be made to the base count models. Examples in Stata, R, and SAS code enable readers to adapt models for their own purposes, making the text an ideal resource for researchers working in health, ecology, econometrics, transportation, and other fields.},

regarding how to link effects to exposure estimates. The exposure assessment methodology was not reviewed
and it is assumed that the current FOCUS surface water exposure assessment methodology will continue to be
used for exposure assessment at EU level. The current GD is intended to be used for authorisation of active
substances at EU level as well as for plant protection products at Member State level. The effect assessment
schemes in this GD allow for the derivation of regulatory acceptable concentrations (RACs) on the basis of two
options: (1) the ecological threshold option (ETO), accepting negligible population effects only, and (2) the
ecological recovery option (ERO), accepting some population-level effects if ecological recovery takes place
within an acceptable time period. In the tiered effect assessment schemes, in principle, all tiers (1, 2 and 3) are
able to address the ETO, while the model ecosystem approach (tier 3), under certain conditions, is able to also
address the ERO. The GD provides the scientific background for the risk assessment to aquatic organisms in
edge-of-field surface waters and is structured to give detailed guidance on all assessment steps. An executive
summary joining all parts of the guidance and decision schemes in a concise way is provided and is intended to
help applicants and regulatory authorities in day-to-day use.},

	abstract = {The arcsine square root transformation has long been standard procedure when analyzing proportional data in ecology, with applications in data sets containing binomial and non-binomial response variables. Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods},

While it has rarely been assessed how likely it is to detect effects given a specific sample size, it was never analysed how reliable results are if the test preconditions, particularly of parametric tests, are not fulfilled or how likely it is to detect deviations from these preconditions. Therefore, we analyse the performance of a parametric and a non-parametric test using Monte Carlo simulation, focussing on typical data used in ecotoxicological risk assessments. We show that none of the data distributions are normal and that for typical sample sizes of N{\textless}20 it is very unlikely to detect deviations from normality. Non-parametric tests performed markedly better than parametric tests, except when data were in fact normally distributed. We finally discuss the impact of using different tests on pesticide risk assessments.},

The concentrations (0, 3.3, 33, 100, 330 and 1000 ?g/l) were kept at a constant level for 4 weeks. This paper is the second of a series of two; it describes the effects on zooplankton and primary producers and presents an overall discussion. The zooplankton community was negatively affected by the three highest treatment levels (NOEC(community) = 33 ?g/l). At higher treatment levels Cladocera taxa were completely eliminated, while Copepod numbers were reduced. Rotatoria taxa decreased (Keratella quadrata and Lecane sp.) or increased in abundance (Testudinella parva) at the highest treatment level only. Due to the reduced grazing pressure, the abundance of some phytoplankton taxa and the chlorophyll-a content of the phytoplankton increased at the three highest treatment levels (NOEC(community) = 33 ?g/l). This effect was not observed for the periphyton, most probably because the reduced grazing pressure was compensated by the increased abundance of some snail species such as Lymnaea stagnalis and Physella acuta. At the end of the experimental period the biomass of the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii was significantly elevated at the two highest treatment levels. It is hypothesised that carbendazim might have caused, directly or indirectly, the removal of pathogene organisms from the macrophyte. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Scientific ecotoxicology and associated topics are defined. The historical perspective, rationale, and characteristics are outlined for the strong inferential and quantitative approach advocated in this book. The general measurement process is discussed, and methodologies for defining and controlling variance, which could otherwise exclude valid conclusions regarding ecotoxicological endeavors, are considered.Ecotoxicological concepts at increasing levels of ecological organization are discussed in the second part of the book. Quantitative methods used to measure toxicant effects are outlined in this section. The final chapter summarizes the book with a brief discussion of ecotoxicological assessment. Numerous figures and tables accompany text, with many statistical tables found in the appendix for quick reference.

	title = {Many zeros does not mean zero inflation: comparing the goodness-of-fit of parametric models to multivariate abundance data},
	volume = {16},
	abstract = {An important step in studying the ecology of a species is choosing a statistical model of abundance; however, there has been little general consideration of which statistical model to use. In particular, abundance data have many zeros (often 50–80 per cent of all values), and zero-inflated count distributions are often used to specifically model the high frequency of zeros in abundance data. However, in such cases it is often taken for granted that a zero-inflated model is required, and the goodness-of-fit to count distributions with and without zero inflation is not often compared for abundance data. In this article, the goodness-of-fit was compared for several marginal models of abundance in 20 multivariate datasets (a total of 1672 variables across all datasets) from different sources. Multivariate abundance data are quite commonly collected in applied ecology, and the properties of these data may differ from abundances collected in autecological studies. Goodness-of-fit was assessed using AIC values, graphs of observed vs expected proportion of zeros in a dataset, and graphs of the sample mean–variance relationship. The negative binomial model was the best fitting of the count distributions, without zero-inflation. The high frequency of zeros was well described by the systematic component of the model (i.e. at some places predicted abundance was high, while at others it was zero) and so it was rarely necessary to modify the random component of the model (i.e. fitting a zero-inflated distribution). A Gaussian model based on transformed abundances fitted data surprisingly well, and rescaled per cent cover was usually poorly fitted by a count distribution. In conclusion, results suggest that the high frequency of zeros commonly seen in multivariate abundance data is best considered to come from distributions where mean abundance is often very low (hence there are many zeros), as opposed to claiming that there are an unusually high number of zeros compared to common parametric distributions.
