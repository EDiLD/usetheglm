	title = {Guidance on tiered risk assessment for plant protection products for aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters},
	volume = {11},
	abstract = {{EFSA}‘s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues ({PPR}) was tasked to revise the Guidance
Document ({GD}) on Aquatic Ecotoxicology under Council Directive 91/414/{EEC} ({SANCO}/3268/2001 rev.4
(final), 17 October 2002). This Guidance of the {PPR} Panel is the first of three requested deliverables within this
mandate. It has its focus on tiered acute and chronic effect assessment schemes with detailed guidance on tier 1
and higher tier effect assessments for aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters and on proposals
regarding how to link effects to exposure estimates. The exposure assessment methodology was not reviewed
and it is assumed that the current {FOCUS} surface water exposure assessment methodology will continue to be
used for exposure assessment at {EU} level. The current {GD} is intended to be used for authorisation of active
substances at {EU} level as well as for plant protection products at Member State level. The effect assessment
schemes in this {GD} allow for the derivation of regulatory acceptable concentrations ({RACs}) on the basis of two
options: (1) the ecological threshold option ({ETO}), accepting negligible population effects only, and (2) the
ecological recovery option ({ERO}), accepting some population-level effects if ecological recovery takes place
within an acceptable time period. In the tiered effect assessment schemes, in principle, all tiers (1, 2 and 3) are
able to address the {ETO}, while the model ecosystem approach (tier 3), under certain conditions, is able to also
address the {ERO}. The {GD} provides the scientific background for the risk assessment to aquatic organisms in
edge-of-field surface waters and is structured to give detailed guidance on all assessment steps. An executive
summary joining all parts of the guidance and decision schemes in a concise way is provided and is intended to
help applicants and regulatory authorities in day-to-day use.},

It then works up to an analysis of the problem of overdispersion and of the negative binomial model, and finally to the many variations that can be made to the base count models.

Scientific ecotoxicology and associated topics are defined. The historical perspective, rationale, and characteristics are outlined for the strong inferential and quantitative approach advocated in this book. The general measurement process is discussed, and methodologies for defining and controlling variance, which could otherwise exclude valid conclusions regarding ecotoxicological endeavors, are considered.Ecotoxicological concepts at increasing levels of ecological organization are discussed in the second part of the book. Quantitative methods used to measure toxicant effects are outlined in this section. The final chapter summarizes the book with a brief discussion of ecotoxicological assessment. Numerous figures and tables accompany text, with many statistical tables found in the appendix for quick reference.

	abstract = {Effects of chronic application of the fungicide {DerosalÆ} (active ingredient carbendazim) were studied in indoor macrophyte-dominated freshwater microcosms. The concentrations (0, 3.3, 33, 100, 330 and 1000 ?g/l) were kept at a constant level for 4 weeks. This paper is the second of a series of two; it describes the effects on zooplankton and primary producers and presents an overall discussion. The zooplankton community was negatively affected by the three highest treatment levels ({NOEC}(community) = 33 ?g/l). At higher treatment levels Cladocera taxa were completely eliminated, while Copepod numbers were reduced. Rotatoria taxa decreased (Keratella quadrata and Lecane sp.) or increased in abundance (Testudinella parva) at the highest treatment level only. Due to the reduced grazing pressure, the abundance of some phytoplankton taxa and the chlorophyll-a content of the phytoplankton increased at the three highest treatment levels ({NOEC}(community) = 33 ?g/l). This effect was not observed for the periphyton, most probably because the reduced grazing pressure was compensated by the increased abundance of some snail species such as Lymnaea stagnalis and Physella acuta. At the end of the experimental period the biomass of the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii was significantly elevated at the two highest treatment levels. It is hypothesised that carbendazim might have caused, directly or indirectly, the removal of pathogene organisms from the macrophyte. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {In environmental risk assessments statistical tests are a standard tool to evaluate the significance of effects by pesticides. While it has rarely been assessed how likely it is to detect effects given a specific sample size, it was never analysed how reliable results are if the test preconditions, particularly of parametric tests, are not fulfilled or how likely it is to detect deviations from these preconditions. Therefore, we analyse the performance of a parametric and a non-parametric test using Monte Carlo simulation, focussing on typical data used in ecotoxicological risk assessments. We show that none of the data distributions are normal and that for typical sample sizes of N{\textless}20 it is very unlikely to detect deviations from normality. Non-parametric tests performed markedly better than parametric tests, except when data were in fact normally distributed. We finally discuss the impact of using different tests on pesticide risk assessments.},

	abstract = {The arcsine square root transformation has long been standard procedure when analyzing proportional data in ecology, with applications in data sets containing binomial and non-binomial response variables. Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods},
