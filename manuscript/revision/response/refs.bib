	abstract = {This Test Guideline describes an acute toxicity test to assess effects of chemicals towards daphnids (usually Daphnia magna Staus). Young daphnids, aged less than 24 hours at the start of the test, are exposed to the test substance at a range of concentrations (at least five concentrations) for a period of 48 hours. Immobilisation is recorded at 24 hours and 48 hours and compared with control values. The results are analysed in order to calculate the EC50 at 48h. Determination of the EC50 at 24h is optional. At least 20 animals, preferably divided into four groups of five animals each, should be used at each test concentration and for the controls. At least 2 ml of test solution should be provided for each animal (i.e. a volume of 10 ml for five daphnids per test vessel). The limit test corresponds to one dose level of 100 mg/L. The study report should include the observation for immobilized daphnids at 24 and 48 hours after the beginning of the test and the measures of dissolved oxygen, pH, concentration of the test substance, at the beginning and end of the test.},

	title = {Impact of the fungicide carbendazim in freshwater microcosms. {II}. {Zooplankton}, primary producers and final conclusions},
	volume = {48},
	abstract = {Effects of chronic application of the fungicide DerosalÆ (active ingredient carbendazim) were studied in indoor macrophyte-dominated freshwater microcosms. The concentrations (0, 3.3, 33, 100, 330 and 1000 ?g/l) were kept at a constant level for 4 weeks. This paper is the second of a series of two; it describes the effects on zooplankton and primary producers and presents an overall discussion. The zooplankton community was negatively affected by the three highest treatment levels (NOEC(community) = 33 ?g/l). At higher treatment levels Cladocera taxa were completely eliminated, while Copepod numbers were reduced. Rotatoria taxa decreased (Keratella quadrata and Lecane sp.) or increased in abundance (Testudinella parva) at the highest treatment level only. Due to the reduced grazing pressure, the abundance of some phytoplankton taxa and the chlorophyll-a content of the phytoplankton increased at the three highest treatment levels (NOEC(community) = 33 ?g/l). This effect was not observed for the periphyton, most probably because the reduced grazing pressure was compensated by the increased abundance of some snail species such as Lymnaea stagnalis and Physella acuta. At the end of the experimental period the biomass of the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii was significantly elevated at the two highest treatment levels. It is hypothesised that carbendazim might have caused, directly or indirectly, the removal of pathogene organisms from the macrophyte. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},
